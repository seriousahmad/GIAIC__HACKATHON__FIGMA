## I created this project using Nextjs 13 since later versions were giving repeated errors on vercel deployment.

## Being a beginner student of coding, I am still learning how to make a webpage responsive, so viewers will not be able to see any responsiveness in this project. But I have used all the extra time and completed the 'large screen' design atleast.

## I hope you like what you see.
